This assignment is catapulting myself back into programming after taking a summer off of touching any code. My goal here was to recreate the website for the game [Decenders](https://www.descendersgame.com/). However, this website is only one page. To go beyond that and expand it, I created a page for each of the games three teams. Finding content for these pages was particularly difficult, and I ended up referencing the [Wiki](https://descenders.fandom.com/wiki/Descenders_Wiki) for the game. I also found a great YouTube tutorial on gaining a sponsorship in the game, so I felt it would be fitting to include. This was a great exercise for me in referencing another website and pushing it beyond what was originally constructed. I claim no rights to the content, as all of it was sourced elsewhere. This was just a great project to get back into coding, using SCSS, and doing my best to make it mobile responsive!
